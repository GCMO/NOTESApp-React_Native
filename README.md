OVERVIEW:

React Native medium difficulty project. From the TodoList app to Notes App. Multipe screens: user-login (no Auth), addNotes, DisplayNotes, EditNotes, DeleteNotes, UpdateNotes. Multiple Components and button: to create, delete, update, check, search notes.

OBJECTIVE:

This is the Fourth project of React Native Development. Took around 5 days, not very satisfied with architecture, but reached a decent UI/UX

LEARNING CURVE: 

Combersome to init the environment and adding libraries which still don't seem to be compiling properly.
Libraries still create conflicts with core bundles and bundlers. Expo is up to date and updated Node to latest stable version. I keep on getting a React.Dom issue that downgrades to React.17 from .18 - I'll look into it more thoroughly in the next few days.
I downloaded both ios & android SDKs but during installation still more packages need to be updated. It could be due to my Mac running on an old OS. Im really considering switching to Flatter.
I must referesh my skills with React props and use more conditional in the rendering function: that makes the content more interactive.
